##Problem Statement
Small to medium-sized libraries and educational institutions often struggles with inefficient and manual methods of tracking their book inventory and managing the borrowing and returnings.
These manual processes lead to inaccuracies in stock counts, delays in processing transactions, and difficulty in ensuring books are returned on time. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and accessible 
digital tool to automate these core functions, thereby improving the efficiency and integrity of the library's daily operations.

##Scope of the project
The scope of this project is to develop a foundational Command Line Interface (CLI) application that handles the three primary operations of library management: Book Management, Member Management, and Loan Management.

##Target Users
-The primary target user for the Library Management System is the Librarian or a Library Staff Member responsible for daily operations.
-They require a tool that is easy to operate quickly via command-line prompts.
-They need to accurately record new books, register new members, process loans, and confirm returns.
-The system is designed for an environment where data consistency and simple transaction tracking are paramount.

##High- level features
The system offers the following key functional capabilities:
-Inventory Control: Ability to add new books, view the full inventory, and keep track of the available copies for each title.

-Member Registry: Simple mechanism to register and view all library members.

-Book Borrowing: A function to record a book loan, link it to a member, and automatically set a 14-day return due date.

-Book Return: A function to successfully mark a loan as completed and return the book to the available inventory.

-Search Capability: Quick search functionality to find books by title or author.
